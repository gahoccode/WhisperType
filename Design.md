# **Speech-to-Text Application - UX/UI & Functional Design Plan**  

## **1. Project Overview**  
This is a **speech-to-text application** designed for users who need a **quick and seamless voice dictation experience**. The app runs in the background and is **triggered by a global keyboard shortcut**. Once activated, it captures voice input, transcribes it using OpenAI Whisper API, and **automatically pastes the transcribed text at the active cursor position**.  

The application provides a **minimal yet functional UI** to allow users to configure essential settings such as **microphone selection, language preference, and hotkey assignment**.

## **2. User Flow & Interaction Design**  

### **A. Activation & Recording Flow**  
1. **User Presses a Global Hotkey (`Ctrl + Alt + V`)**  
   - The app is triggered and becomes **visible with an animated voice wave icon**, indicating it is actively listening.  
   
2. **User Speaks Freely**  
   - The app captures voice input from the **selected microphone**.  
   - The animated icon remains **active and dynamic** while recording.  

3. **Transcription & Output Handling**  
   - The recorded audio is **transcribed into text using OpenAI Whisper API**, respecting the user’s **selected output language**.  
   - The transcribed text is **automatically pasted** where the user’s cursor is currently active.  
   - The app then **closes or returns to standby mode**.  

---

### **B. Settings & Customization Flow**  
1. **User Opens the Settings Window** (via the main app interface)  
   - The user can configure:  
     ✅ **Microphone Selection** – Choose from a list of available recording devices.  
     ✅ **Language Selection** – Select the transcription language (English, Vietnamese, Spanish, etc.).  
     ✅ **Hotkey Configuration** – Modify the shortcut key for activation.  

2. **User Saves & Applies Settings**  
   - Changes are applied in real-time, and the app continues running in the background.

## **3. Key Features & Functional Requirements**  

### **A. Core Features**  
✔ **Global Hotkey Activation** – Allows users to call the app anytime using a customizable shortcut (`Ctrl + Alt + V`).  
✔ **Speech-to-Text Transcription** – Uses **OpenAI Whisper API** for accurate and multi-language transcription.  
✔ **Automatic Text Insertion** – Transcribed text is **directly typed into the active cursor position**.  
✔ **Real-time Recording Indicator** – A floating, animated **sound wave icon** appears while recording.  

### **B. Customization & User Preferences**  
✔ **Microphone Selection** – Users can choose their preferred input device.  
✔ **Language Support** – Allows selection of transcription language (English, Vietnamese, etc.).  
✔ **Hotkey Configuration** – Users can customize the activation shortcut via the **tkinter GUI settings window**.  

### **C. Background & Usability Enhancements**  
✔ **Minimal UI / System Tray Mode** – The app runs discreetly in the background.  
✔ **Error Handling & Notifications** – Displays alerts when no microphone is detected, no speech is recognized, or API errors occur.  
✔ **Performance Optimization** – Ensures low latency and smooth operation during voice-to-text processing.

## **4. UI & UX Considerations**  

### **A. Visual Feedback (Animated Sound Wave Indicator)**  
- Upon activation, the app **displays a floating sound wave animation**, visually indicating that it is recording.  
- This UI element helps **reinforce user confidence** that their speech is being captured.  

### **B. Settings UI (Minimal & Functional)**  
- The settings window provides a **clean, dropdown-based interface** to select the microphone, language, and hotkey.  
- All settings **persist** even when the app is closed.  

### **C. Accessibility & User Convenience**  
- Users **never need to manually open the app**; the shortcut **instantly** enables speech capture.  
- No extra steps are required—**just speak, and the text appears where needed**.

## **5. Future Enhancements & Additional Features**  
📌 **System Tray Integration** – Allow the app to run in the tray with a right-click menu for quick settings.  
📌 **Voice Command Support** – Users can say commands like “Delete last word” or “New paragraph.”  
📌 **Multi-Mode Output** – Option to paste directly **or** copy to clipboard instead.  
📌 **Adjustable Recording Duration** – Users can set a max speech time before auto-submission.

## **6. Final Thought**  
This application **prioritizes simplicity, speed, and usability**, ensuring users can dictate text **instantly and efficiently** without manually handling the transcription process. **The intuitive UI design ensures ease of use, while customizable settings provide flexibility for different user needs.** 🚀🎤  

Would you like additional refinements in **UI interaction design**, or should I proceed with **system tray integration**? 😊
